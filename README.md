### Algorithm 1
> Stepwise execution of the algorithm


- [x] MainTestNegFIN.java is the main file which needs to be executed. The code allows flexibility to choose Rank, 
this value can be entered manually while executing the code.

- [x] contextdata.txt is the input to the MainTestNegFIN.java. 
Here, we store real data which is referenced from Link : http://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/index.php?link=datasets.php

- [x] output.txt, Support.txt is the output of the algorithm.
